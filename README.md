# Spotify Bookmarking App

This app allows to subscribe to a Spotify playlist of an audio book and track the progress. 
The app will save the last position within the audio book and allows for resuming the playback.


The app requires the Device Broadcast status being turned on in the Spotify settings. Otherwise the app will not receive any notification from the Spotify app.
